# Chalkboard.ai: A revolutionary study tool that utilizes the Llama3 Model to transcribe YouTube/personal videos into customizable notes for any subject

- Our study tool targets students that have missed lectures or are looking for a quick summary on content that they need to learn. The solution that we’ve developed saves students from having to watch through entire lecture videos and instead allows them to study the main concepts. With LlamaIndex readers, we streamlined the process of uploading videos so that the user can upload YouTube links or directly from local files. The readers transform the uploads into a transcript which is then analyzed by the Llama3 Model, which extracts the key points from the transcript. We’ve given the user an option to adjust the conciseness of these notes depending on whether they just want a quick summary or a comprehensive review of the lecture. Once the summarized notes are generated, the user can choose to edit the notes directly on the website. On top of that, our MongoDB database enables users to organize and save their notes into distinguishable folders, providing the app with immense reuse value. Or, they can opt to save their notes as a pdf/docx. In the future, we’d like to implement a Question/Answer feature where the user can ask questions about the content. We would also like to implement a calendar where users can schedule their classes, assignments, notes, etc. for further organization. 

- This was Built in Python, HTML, and CSS using Streamlit and Meta's LLaMA
- The backend is built in MongoDB using pymongo
- Built for LabLab.ai 48 hr LLaMa3 Hackathon
