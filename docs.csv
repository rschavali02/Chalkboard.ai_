0,finalChalkboardAi.mp4,"For our idea for the lab lab AI llama three hackathon, we decided to build Chalkboard AI, a revolutionary study tool that utilizes the llama three model to transcribe YouTube and personal videos into customizable notes for any subject. The purpose of this was to provide quick and concise summary and allow students that miss lectures to catch up on lectures or students that have learning disabilities or need help learning in a different way to aid them in their learning process. Our architecture for this we use streamlit and Python for our front end where you can upload lecture video files, input educational YouTube links, and then adjust the depth of the generated notes. Then you can edit, modify, and sort collections of notes. Our database or backend was built with MongoDB with note management that saves notes, retrieves notes, and deletes notes using MongoDB integrated with custom handlers. Our backend was built with Python and of course the llama three model. This extracts audio from local video files using custom utility and it also transcribes videos using YouTube transcript reader for YouTube from Llamahub and uses AssemblyAI audio transcript reader for audio files, which is also part of the llama index Llama Hub. Lastly, it generates detailed and customizable notes based on video transcript through the llama Olama model. We convert notes into a downloadable docx and PDF formats at the end. Lastly, with marketing with our market sizing addressing our total global market, the global edtech market is ranked at $254 billion. We see that with $5 per student, at 1.5 billion students, we mark our total market would be $7.5 billion. With our serviceable addressable market focusing on english speaking countries, specifically high school or college students and professional learners, this would be 300 million and our revenue would be with a subscription model per month. Meanwhile, our main selling point over our competitors is the ability to customize detailedness of our notes and save them. Lastly, for our demo, if we look here, this is chalkboard AI's interface. As soon as you open chalkboard AI, you'll notice that there's a description, a note taker for YouTube lectures or any video, and you can generate edit your notes or save your notes and download. You can first drag and drop a file here in the mp4, MKV, Avi, mov, or MPEG four formats. Or you can enter a YouTube link. Let's try that. So here we have a YouTube link right here that I enter in. I enter the subject. It was a grammar video. So english language arts and a name will say grammar notes intro. Here we can adjust the detail level, which, as I was saying, one is for more simple notes versus ten is for more detailed. Let's stick with five for now. Now, as I generate the notes, you can see that you can view notes by subject here at the bottom. Here we can sort by a couple notes that we've already done. So here there's a computer science subject, history, ML, math and science. Here I created a new subject for ELA to save these notes. You can click all notes to view every notes, or you can click on each one of these to select notes from these specific topics. Something in the future we want to do is integrate a calendar where students will be able to see what days they've uploaded, what notes, and figure out what they're doing and where exams are. For now, this is just an aesthetic viewpoint of a chalkboard and our apps mascot. Now our app finished running, we can see that we have a title, an introduction, key points with notes under each one, multiple key points, and then a conclusion. This is under the five detail. If we went to ten, it would be a lot more detailed. Now, if we save the if we download the notes as a PDF or DocX, you'll see that the notes are downloaded and then we can open them in the PDF or DocX format. Finally, you can see all your notes ever made. Now, here at the bottom, we have our grammar notes because they're ranked in chronological order where you can download them. Here, you can edit them here like this, and you can delete the file. Now you can look through history notes and there's multiple notes you can look through mathematic and these are just some videos that we looked through before. If your note is unnamed, it'll be saved as an unnamed note because there's no title for it. Lastly, we customize our UI to look like a chalkboard. And by that we mean with a black background and gray boxes outlined with brown wood like outlines. Thank you. That's all we have today."
